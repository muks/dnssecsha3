    <abstract>
      <t>This document describes how to produce RSA/SHA3-256,
      RSA/SHA3-384, and RSA/SHA3-512 DNSKEY and RRSIG resource records
      for use in the Domain Name System Security Extensions (<xref
      target="RFC4033" />, <xref target="RFC4034" />, and <xref
      target="RFC4035" />).</t>
    </abstract>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>The Domain Name System (DNS) is the global, hierarchical
      distributed database for Internet Naming. The DNS has been
      extended to use cryptographic keys and digital signatures for the
      verification of the authenticity and integrity of its data. <xref
      target="RFC4033" />, <xref target="RFC4034" />, and <xref
      target="RFC4035" /> describe these DNS Security Extensions, called
      DNSSEC.</t>

      <t><xref target="RFC4033" /> describes how to store DNSKEY and
      RRSIG resource records, and specified a list of cryptographic
      algorithms to use. It was further updated by <xref
      target="RFC5702" /> to add the SHA-2 family of hash
      algorithms. This document extends that list with the SHA-3
      algorithms RSA/SHA3-256, RSA/SHA3-384, and RSA/SHA3-512, and
      specifies how to store DNSKEY data and how to produce RRSIG
      resource records with these hash algorithms.</t>

      <t>Familiarity with DNSSEC, RSA, and the SHA-3 <xref
      target="FIPS.202.2015" /> family of algorithms is assumed in this
      document.</t>

      <t>To refer to SHA3-256, SHA3-384, and SHA3-512, this document
      will use the name SHA-3. This is done to improve readability. When
      a part of text is specific for a particular SHA-3 hash function,
      their specific names are used. The same goes for RSA/SHA3-256,
      RSA/SHA3-384, and RSA/SHA3-512, which will be grouped using the
      name RSA/SHA-3.</t>

      <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL
      NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL"
      in this document are to be interpreted as described in <xref
      target="RFC2119" />.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="DNSKEY Resource Records" anchor="rrs">
      <t>The format of the DNSKEY RR can be found in <xref
      target="RFC4034" />. <xref target="RFC3110" /> and <xref
      target="RFC5702" /> describe the use of RSA/SHA-1 and RSA/SHA-2
      for DNSSEC signatures respectively.</t>

      <section title="RSA/SHA3-256 DNSKEY Resource Records">
        <t>RSA public keys for use with RSA/SHA3-256 are stored in
        DNSKEY resource records (RRs) with the algorithm number
        [TBD].</t>

        <t>The key size of RSA/SHA3-256 keys MUST NOT be less than 1024
        bits and MUST NOT be more than 4096 bits.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="RSA/SHA3-384 DNSKEY Resource Records">
        <t>RSA public keys for use with RSA/SHA3-384 are stored in
        DNSKEY resource records (RRs) with the algorithm number
        [TBD].</t>

        <t>The key size of RSA/SHA3-384 keys MUST NOT be less than 1024
        bits and MUST NOT be more than 4096 bits.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="RSA/SHA3-512 DNSKEY Resource Records">
        <t>RSA public keys for use with RSA/SHA3-512 are stored in
        DNSKEY resource records (RRs) with the algorithm number
        [TBD].</t>

        <t>The key size of RSA/SHA3-512 keys MUST NOT be less than 1024
        bits and MUST NOT be more than 4096 bits.</t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section title="RRSIG Resource Records">
      <t>The value of the signature field in the RRSIG RR follows the
      RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5 signature scheme and is calculated as follows.
      The values for the RDATA fields that precede the signature data
      are specified in <xref target="RFC4034" />.</t>

      <figure>
        <artwork>
      hash = SHA3-XXX(data)
        </artwork>
      </figure>

      <t>Here XXX is either 256, 384, or 512, depending on the algorithm
      used, as specified in <xref target="FIPS.202.2015" />; "data" is
      the wire format data of the resource record set that is signed, as
      specified in <xref target="RFC4034" />.</t>

      <figure>
        <artwork>
      signature = ( 00 | 01 | FF* | 00 | prefix | hash ) ** e (mod n)
        </artwork>
      </figure>

      <t>Here "|" is concatenation; "00", "01", "FF", and "00" are fixed
      octets of corresponding hexadecimal value; "e" is the private
      exponent of the signing RSA key; and "n" is the public modulus of
      the signing key.  The FF octet MUST be repeated the exact number
      of times so that the total length of the concatenated term in
      parentheses equals the length of the modulus of the signer's
      public key ("n").</t>

      <t>The "prefix" is intended to make the use of standard
      cryptographic libraries easier.  These specifications are taken
      directly from the specifications of RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5 in PKCS #1
      v2.1 (Section 8.2 of <xref target="RFC3447" />), and
      EMSA-PKCS1-v1_5 encoding in PKCS #1 v2.1 (Section 9.2 of <xref
      target="RFC3447" />).  The prefixes for the different algorithms
      are specified below.</t>

        <t>RSA/SHA3-256 signatures are stored in the DNS using RRSIG
        resource records (RRs) with algorithm number [TBD].</t>

        <t>The "prefix" is the ASN.1 DER SHA3-256 algorithm designator
        prefix:</t>

      <section title="RSA/SHA3-384 RRSIG Resource Records">
        <t>RSA/SHA3-384 signatures are stored in the DNS using RRSIG
        resource records (RRs) with algorithm number [TBD].</t>

        <t>The "prefix" is the ASN.1 DER SHA3-384 algorithm designator

    <section title="Deployment Considerations">
      <section title="Key Sizes">
        <t>Apart from the restrictions in <xref target="rrs" />, this
        document will not specify what size of keys to use. That is an
        operational issue and depends largely on the environment and
        intended use. A good starting point for more information would
        be <xref target="NIST800-57" />.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Signature Sizes">
        <t>In this family of signing algorithms, the size of signatures
        is related to the size of the key and not to the hashing
        algorithm used in the signing process. Therefore, RRSIG resource
        records produced with RSA/SHA3-256, RSA/SHA3-384, or
        RSA/SHA3-512 will have the same size as those produced with
        RSA/SHA-1 and RSA/SHA-2 hash algorithms, if the keys have the
        same length.</t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section title="Implementation Considerations">
      <section title="Support for SHA-3 Signatures">
        <t>DNSSEC-aware implementations SHOULD be able to support RRSIG
        and DNSKEY resource records created with the RSA/SHA-3
        algorithms as defined in this document.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Support for NSEC3 Denial of Existence">
        <t><xref target="RFC5155" /> defines new algorithm identifiers
        for existing signing algorithms, to indicate that zones signed
        with these algorithm identifiers can use NSEC3 as well as NSEC
        records to provide denial of existence. That mechanism was
        chosen to protect implementations predating <xref
        target="RFC5155" /> from encountering resource records about
        which they could not know. This document does not define such
        algorithm aliases.</t>

        <t>A DNSSEC validator that implements RSA/SHA-3 MUST be able to
        validate negative answers in the form of both NSEC and NSEC3
        with hash algorithm 1, as defined in <xref target="RFC5155" />.
        An authoritative server that does not implement NSEC3 MAY still
        serve zones that use RSA/SHA-3 with NSEC denial of
        existence.</t>

    <section title="Security considerations">
      <section title="SHA-1/SHA-2 versus SHA-3 Considerations for RRSIG Resource Records">
	<t>DNSSEC implementations are encouraged to implement SHA-3 as
	soon as possible now that SHA-1's security is known to be
	degraded and the SHA-2 hash algorithms are currently the last
	line of defence for use with RSA.</t>
	
	<t>Users of DNS software are encouraged to deploy SHA-3 with
	DNSSEC when software implementations allow for it. Users are
	encouraged to run DNSSEC validator implementations that support
	SHA-3.</t>

	<t>SHA-3 is considered sufficiently strong for the immediate
	future, but predictions about future development in cryptography
	and cryptanalysis are beyond the scope of this document.</t>

	<t>The signature scheme RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5 is chosen to match the
	one used for RSA/SHA-1 signatures. This should ease
	implementation of the new hashing algorithms in DNSSEC
	software.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Signature Type Downgrade Attacks">
	<t>Since each RRSet MUST be signed with each algorithm present
	in the DNSKEY RRSet at the zone apex (see Section 2.2 of <xref
	target="RFC4035" />), a malicious party cannot filter out the
	RSA/SHA-3 RRSIG and force the validator to use a RSA/SHA-1
	signature if both are present in the zone. This should provide
	resilience against algorithm downgrade attacks, if the validator
	supports RSA/SHA-3.</t>
